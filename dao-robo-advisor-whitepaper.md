# DAO Robo Advisor Whitepaper

#### Executive Summary

**Purpose**

The purpose of this whitepaper is to present the Vault and Treasury Robo Advisors developed to optimize DAO treasury management, addressing inefficiencies and risks inherent in current treasury management practices.

**Problem Addressed**

DAO treasury management faces challenges such as inefficiencies, high risks, and the complexity of managing diverse assets. Traditional approaches lack the sophistication required to maximize returns while minimizing risks.

**Overview of Solutions**

The Vault Robo Advisor and Treasury Robo Advisor offer advanced portfolio management solutions using Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to achieve superior performance metrics like improved Sortino and Sharpe ratios, and optimized asset allocations.

#### Introduction

**Background on DAO Treasury Management**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) manage significant amounts of assets, often in diverse forms such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other digital assets. Efficient management of these treasuries is crucial for the long-term sustainability and growth of DAOs.

**Vault Robo Advisor Overview**

The Vault Robo Advisor leverages DAI ceiling adjustments to drive optimal portfolio weights, simulating the effects of these adjustments on vault USD balances to ensure optimal allocation and risk management.

**Treasury Robo Advisor Introduction**

The Treasury Robo Advisor provides a comprehensive solution for direct portfolio rebalancing, allowing DAOs to adjust their asset allocations based on predefined strategies and market conditions, ensuring better returns and risk management.

#### Problem Statement

**Issues in Current Treasury Management**

* **Inefficiencies**: Manual management of assets leads to suboptimal asset allocations and missed opportunities.
* **Risks**: High exposure to volatile assets without proper risk mitigation strategies.
* **Complexity**: Managing a diverse portfolio requires sophisticated tools and strategies.

**Inefficiencies and Risks**

* **Lack of Automation**: Manual processes are time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Volatility**: Without advanced models, portfolios are exposed to unnecessary risks.
* **Scalability Issues**: Traditional methods are not scalable for large and diverse portfolios.

#### Proposed Solutions

**Vault Robo Advisor**

**Model Description**

The Vault Robo Advisor uses DAI ceiling adjustments to achieve optimal portfolio weights, simulating vault USD changes resulting from these adjustments.

**Methodology**

* **MVO Version**: Computes actions by measuring the distance of current weights from optimized weights.
* **RL Version**: Uses reinforcement learning to determine actions, with rewards incorporating MVO outcomes.
* **Models**:
  * **MVO with Sortino Ratio Target**: Optimizes portfolio based on Sortino ratio.
  * **Multivariate Linear Regression with Ridge Hyper-Tuning**: Predicts optimal allocations.
  * **RL Model**: Learns optimal strategies over time.

**Performance Results**

* **MVO**: Demonstrated improved Sortino ratios on historical data.
* **Multivariate Linear Regression**: Performed well in time series cross-validation.
* **RL Model**: Outperformed historical performance in both return and Sortino ratio.

**Treasury Robo Advisor**

**Model Description**

Tracks DAO returns based on portfolio composition and allows rebalancing within user-defined frequency parameters.

**Direct Portfolio Rebalancing**

Unlike the Vault Robo Advisor, this model directly rebalances the portfolio, making it applicable to most DAOs and suitable for on-chain Robo Advisor managed funds.

**Performance Results**

* **RL Model**: Outperformed on Sortino ratio and market risk.
* **MVO Model**: Outperformed on cumulative return and CAGR.

* Backtesting Results
* Performance Metrics (Sortino Ratio, Cumulative Returns)

#### Benefits and Impact

**Advantages for DAOs and Investors**

* **Enhanced Returns**: Optimized asset allocations improve returns.
* **Risk Mitigation**: Advanced models minimize exposure to volatility and downside risks.
* **Scalability**: Automated processes enable efficient management of large portfolios.

**Broader Implications for DeFi**

The implementation of these advisors sets a new standard for treasury management, contributing to the overall stability and growth of the DeFi ecosystem.

#### Future Work and Roadmap

**Upcoming Features and Developments**

* **Development of Solidity contracts and integration with Python Script:**
* **Sharpe and Treynor Ratio Calculations**: Additional performance metrics for comprehensive evaluation.
* **Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Advanced risk measures.
* **Integration with More Assets**: Expanding the asset universe for broader applicability.
* **Add dynamic rebalancing for vault model:**
*   **Integration of Web3 Wallets for Logging and Submission**

    In the future, users will have the ability to link their Web3 wallets to log their simulation runs. This feature will allow users to automatically track and record their optimal runs, which can then be submitted to the DAO Lab for evaluation and training purposes.
*   **Crowdsourced Optimization and Governance Token Rewards**

    Users who contribute their optimal runs to the DAO Lab will be rewarded with a governance token. This token incentivizes participation and feedback, effectively crowdsourcing the testing and optimization process. The DAO Lab will use these submissions to refine and enhance the models, benefiting from a wide range of real-world data and scenarios..

**Partnerships and Expansions**

* **DAO Lab as Development Organization**: Community-driven development for continuous improvement. Individuals can earn governance NFT through doing tasks for the DAO, such as having a commit to the GitHub approved by the DAO, or submitting optimal run data for model training.
* **Partnerships with Other DAOs and DeFi Projects**: Collaborative growth and innovation.

#### Conclusion

**Summary of Key Points**

The Vault and Treasury Robo Advisors offer innovative solutions for DAO treasury management, providing superior returns and risk management through advanced models and automation.

**Reinforcement of Value Proposition**

By integrating these advisors, DAOs can achieve better financial outcomes, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.
